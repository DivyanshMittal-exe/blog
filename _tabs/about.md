Welcome to my blog! Here I write about topics ranging from history, facts about coding, random trivia, or anything else interesting I come across.

I extend my gratitude to all who join me on this journey, and I sincerely hope that you find my blogs enjoyable to read!

## Who am I ?

Hi! I am Divyansh, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, where I can immerse myself in a field that fuels my passion for programming and technological innovation.

Aside from my coding, I also enjoy engaging in various sports such as tennis, chess, and badminton. When I'm not on the sports field or immersed in programming, I often find solace in the pages of nonfiction books, exploring topics that broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the world.

Gaming is another passion of mine, particularly open world and action-adventure games. Not only do I derive immense enjoyment from playing these games, but I also find great satisfaction in the creative process of game development.

>Fun Fact: On my 36th birthday, which falls on the 19th of January, 2038, the signed 32-bit Unix time will encounter an integer overflow issue that occurs after 03:14:07 UTC on the 19th of January, 2038. At this point, the time will be interpreted as 20:45:52 UTC on the 13th of December, 1901. Be prepared for the Y2038!
