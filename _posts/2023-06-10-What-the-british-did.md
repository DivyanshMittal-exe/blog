>The British conquest of India was the invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company utterly without scruple or principle, careless of art and greedy of gain, over-running
with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing,
and beginning that career of illegal and ‘legal’ plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred
and seventy-three years. -William Durant


After the fall of the Mughal empire, the British managed to gain control over vast regions of land, through artillery and their cynistic and amoral behaviour. They outright bought nawabs and maharajas for a price, emptied their treasuries, annexed land from farmers, and imposed laws like the ‘doctrine of lapse’. 

>The little court disappears—trade languishes—the capital decays the people are impoverished—the Englishman flourishes, and acts like a sponge, drawing up riches from the banks of the Ganges, and squeezing them down upon the banks of the Thames. - John Sullivan

In the 18th century, India contributed 23% to the world's economy (27% in the 1700s). This number dropped to 3% by the time the Britishers left India.

This all began in the 1600s when the British East India Company started trading silk and spices with India. They began building outposts along the Indian coast in places like Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. They further started having military personnel to protect these outposts. At that time, the Mughal Empire stretched from Kabul to Bengal,
and from Kashmir to Karnataka.

About 150 years later, the Mughal Empire collapsed. The Persian ruler Nadir Shah, looted and burned the Mughal capital, Delhi. The capital burned for 8 weeks, and they took away so much wealth; for the next 3 years, all taxes were removed in Persia.

In 1757, Robert Clive helped the Company win the famous battle of Plassey, to over-rule Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal, using superior artillery and betrayal by the Nawab close noble, Mir Jafar, who was placed on the throne in exchange for control of Bengal. Clive managed to transfer nearly all the contents of the Nawab's wealth to England.

By 1857, when the first open revolt against them took place, the East India Company controlled the lives of more than 200 million people(nearly all of the population of India at that time). They determined their economic, social and political life. Shaped their education, made railways and set up industries for them.

The Company ran India, and like all companies, it had one principal concern shared by its capitalist overlords in London. The British industrial revolution was assisted by destroying existing and flourishing Indian industries.

### Destroying the Indian Textile

The Indian handloom was much superior in quality and highly sought after in Britain. For centuries, the weavers of Bengal produced some of the world's most desirable fabrics, especially the fine muslins, light as 'woven air'.

Textile exports for Bengal alone were about 16 million rupees annually in the 1750s, of which 5-6 million were exported to European traders alone. (This was when a rich man earned 8 rupees a week).

Everything changed after the 1750s when the Britishers were no longer traders but also rulers. They stopped paying in pounds and instead used revenues extracted from Bengal itself!

They established a monopoly and didn't allow any other foreign entity from India to trade and import textiles.

Indian textile was also very cheap. The Britishers could not compete, so they decided to smash the looms of some Bengal weavers and break the thumbs of others.

The weavers, which survived this destructive wrath, were hit by duties and tariffs of over 80%, making export to Britain unviable. Much cheaper fabric from the mills of Britain flooded the Indian market.

India still grew cotton, but most of it was exported to Britain. This monopoly turned weavers into beggars, and many were forced into agriculture beyond the levels the land could support. Mostly the men tilled the fields, and the women spun the cotton. Now this was no longer the case and no backup source of income in case of drought.

Many make the argument that the Indian textile would have anyways been wiped out by the machines of the Industrial Revolution. While the mass-spun fabric would have taken over these traditional looms, this change would have been much more gradual had the Britishers not interfered. It could have been delayed by introducing taxes and tariffs on importing this fabric. Further, due to the relatively lower wages, many manufacturers would have imported this technology and produced cloth much cheaper than in Europe.

Still, some modern mills started to pop up in the 1850s. The American Civil War gave a brief bloom to Indian cotton production, although it soon died in 1865 when the war ended. Till the late 1900s, only 8 per cent of the cloth consumed in India was produced by Indian mills. By 1913, this grew to 20 per cent. In 1936 this number rose to 63 per cent, and by Independence, 76 per cent of the cloth we consumed was produced by Indian mills.
