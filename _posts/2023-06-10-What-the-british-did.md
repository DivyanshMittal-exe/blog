>The British conquest of India was the invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company utterly without scruple or principle, careless of art and greedy of gain, over-running
with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing,
and beginning that career of illegal and ‘legal’ plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred
and seventy-three years. -William Durant


After the fall of the Mughal empire, the British managed to gain control over vast regions of land, through artillery and their cynistic and amoral behaviour. They outright bought nawabs and maharajas for a price, emptied their treasuries, annexed land from farmers, and imposed laws like the ‘doctrine of lapse’. 

>The little court disappears—trade languishes—the capital decays the people are impoverished—the Englishman flourishes, and acts like a sponge, drawing up riches from the banks of the Ganges, and squeezing them down upon the banks of the Thames. - John Sullivan


In the 18th century, India contributed 23% to the world's economy (It was 27% in the 1700s). This number dropped down to 3% by the time the britishers left india.

This all began in the 1600s, when the british east india company started trading with silk and spices with india. They started building outposts along the indian coast in places like Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. They further started having military personnel to protect these outposts. At that time the Mughal Empire stretched from Kabul to Bengal,
and from Kashmir to Karnataka.

About 150 years later, the mughal empire was collapsing. The persian ruler Nadir Shah, looted and burned the mughal capital, Delhi. The capital burned for 8 weeks, and they took away so much wealth, for the next 3 years all taxes were removed in Persia.

In 1757, Robert Clive, helped the Company win the famous battle of Plassey, to over-rule Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal, using superior artillery and betrayal by the nawabs close noble, Mir Jafar, who was placed on the throne in exchange of control of Bengal. Clive managed to transfer nearly all of the contents of the nawabs wealth to England.

By 1857, when the first open revolt against them took place, the East India Company controlled the lives of more than 200 million people(nearly all of the population of India at that time) They determined their economic, socail and political life. Shaped their education, made railways and set up industries for them.

The Company ran India, and like all companies, it had one principal concern, shared by its capitalist overlords in London. The british industrial revolution was assisted by the destruction of existing and flourishing indian industries.

### Destroying the Indian Textile

The Indian handloom used to be much superior in quality and highly sought after in Britain. For centuries, the weavers of Bengal produced some of the world’s most desirable fabrics, specially the fine muslins, light as ‘woven air’.

Textile exports for Bengal alone, were about 16 million ruppees annually in 1750s, out of which 5-6 million was exported to European traders alone. (This was a time when a rich man earned 8 ruppees a week).

After 1750s, when the Britishers were no longer traders, but also rulers, everything changed. They stopped paying in pounds, and instead used revenues extracted from Bengal itself!

They established a monopoly, and didn't allow any other foreign entity to trade and import textiles from India.

Indian textile was also very cheap. The Britishers were unable to compete, so they decided to smash the looms of some bengal weavers and break the thumbs of others.

The weavers which survived this destructive wrath, were hit by the duties and tariffs of over 80%, making export to Britain unviable. Much cheaper fabric, from the mills of Britain, flooded the Indian market.

> the bones of the cotton weavers were bleaching the plains of India -Lord William Bentinck

India still grew cotton, but most of it was exported to Britain. This monopoly, turned weavers into beggers, and many were forced into agriculture, beyond the levels the land could support. Mostly the men tilled the fields and the women spun the cotton. Now this was no longer the case, and in case of a drought no backup source of income.

Many make the argument, that the Indian textile would have anyways been wiped out by the machines of the Industrial revolution. While the mass-spun textile would have taken over these traditional looms, this change would have been much more gradual had the Britishers not interfered. It would have perhaps been delayed, by introducing taxes and tariffs on importing this fabric. Further many manufactures would have imported this technology and produce cloth much cheaper than Europe due to the relatively lower wages.

Still some modern mills started to pop up in the 1850s. The American Civil War gave a brief bloom to Indian cotton production, although it soon died till 1865, when the war ended. Till the late 1900s, only 8 percent of the cloth consumed in India was produced by Indian mills. By the 1913, this grew to 20 percent. In 1936 this number rose to 63 percent, and by the time of Independence, 76 percent of cloth we consumed was produced by Indian mills.
