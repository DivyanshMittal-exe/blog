## History of the first fiat coin falling

 Around the same time India started minting coins, in other places like Lidya, Europe, and China, Asia coins out of gold and silver started getting minted into coins of equal weights, thus making them fungible.

 Their use exploded, when they made it to the one of the oldest named cities in the world, having been continuously inhabited for perhaps 5,000 years: Athens. It was the first society with a tax system and a free market. They have created great pieces of art and architecture.

 Too much greed and too much war is what lead to their downfall. When Athens got involved in the Peloponnasian war: A war with Sparta, their problems began.
  - They lost access to their gold and silver mines.
  - They paid armies which were far away from athens, thus coinage started trickling out of Athens.
  - They debased their currency to pay for the war: By taking 1000 pure gold coins and adding 50% copper to it, we now suddenly have 2000 coins, which can now be used to pay for the war.

> Gresham's Law: Bad money drives out good money

As more of these "bad coins" with the same face value started to come into circulation, people started to save up the pure gold coins, thus decreasing their supply and making them rare. Suddenly the value of the pure gold coin was much more than these copper coins, which in theory should be holding the same value. This drove Athens into the state of hyperinflation, and this financial instability caused the fall of their empire. 

## Seven Stages of Empire

This is a cycle of going from quality money to quantity currency, which keeps repeating over and over again, yet we learn nothing from it.

- **Stage 1**: We start with good money, usually gold or silver or money backed by them.
- **Stage 2**: This money is now used in the development of the nation and societal welfare.
- **Stage 3**: This money is now used to fund massive militaries.
- **Stage 4**: The empire uses this military and goes on a war. The expenditure explodes.
- **Stage 5**: The empire debases the currency to print unlimited amounts of it to fund the war.
- **Stage 6**: The population looses faith in this currency 
- **Stage 7**: People move from currency to gold and silver or tangible assets. The currency collapses and prices of gold and silver shoot up. The wealth gets transfered from people holding it in the form of currency to the people holding it in the form of money.

## The Current Scenario
During WW1 and WW2, the US only got involved during the latter parts of the war. For most parts of the war, it was supplying the world with grains and consumer goods, because other nations were busy getting their young men trained for the war or prepare militaty equipment for the war. The US was paid in gold, and as a result by the end of WW2, US had 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the worlds monetary gold, and Europe had none. A lot of loans in the form of dollars were given to Europe, so Europe was flooded with dollars.

To stabilise these currencies, leaders from around the world came together to come up with the Bretton Woods System in 1944. Under this system, most of the world's currencies were now backed by the US Dollar, and the US Dollar was backed by gold.

Although, no ratio defining the percentage of gold reserve required to print a dollar was set. So the US just kept printing the dollar. Countries as a result started asking US for gold in exchange for dollars. Between 1959-1971, in just 12 years, US lost half of its gold reserve. But 12 times more dollars were in circulation than the gold US had. In 1971, thus US declared, that it won't back its dollars with gold, and thus nearly all the currencies of the world became fiat currencies, and the world just agreed and went along.
